I decided for qt since it has a very nice API and gui designer. 
The file MainWindow.py is automatically generated using the command

  pyuic4 MainWindow.ui -o MainWindow.py

To edit the gui use

  designer-qt4 MainWindow.ui

As far as I remember correctly, the following packages are required (on Fedora):
- for running the gui: PyQt4, PyOpenGl
- for development (contains the qt designer): PyQt4-devel 

js850> for ubuntu, I had to install python-qt4, python-opengl, python-qt4-gl
